# Udacity Project
This web application does the simple work of maintaining school attendance. Click [here](https://suneet-m.github.io/School-Attendance/) to launch.\
This project is a part of Udactiy's FEND program. It was just a exercise to test our refactoring skills based on a method of creating Model, Octopus and View nodes.\
The aim of adopting this coding practise is quite straight-forward. It helps the dev organise code into small packets which creates an extensible and scalable code.\
Which simply means that you can easily extend it to have more actions without compromising the already present functionality.\
Also you can easily scale-up the app by adding or removing data and the rest functionality will remain the same as the display gets adjusted for more data.\
The [app.js](js/app.js) in `js/` folder is the original file I was provided which contains the spaghetti code.\
The refactored code is in [refactor_app.js](js/refactor_app.js) file in the same folder.
